# NBA_Parlay_Predictor
Making an app that gives you optimized predictions for nba parlays based on given context on the day (Recently trending stats, key matchup comparisons, active/inactive players, injury reports, etc.) I wanna use NBA API as well as odds-api because they offer a free 500 calls per month, figured my broke self can make that work!
